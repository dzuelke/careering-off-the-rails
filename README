CareeringOffTheRails
=======================

This is a port of Jobeet from the Symfony Framework to Agavi.

While only the general structure and templates remain similar,
it should still give a good idea about the differences between the
two frameworks and hopefully be a good reference for other projects.

You can find the Jobeet demo site [here](http://www.jobeet.org/)

Installation
============

	git clone http://github.com/enixu/careering-off-the-rails.git careering-off-the-rails

	cd careering-off-the-rails

	git submodule update --init --recursive

/app/cache, /app/data and /public/upload need to be writable from the web server.

LICENSE
