CareeringOffTheRails
=======================

This is a port of Jobeet from the Symfony Framework to Agavi.

While only the general structure and templates remain similar,
it should still give a good idea about the differences between the
two frameworks and hopefully be a good reference for other projects.

You can find the original Jobeet demo site [here](http://www.jobeet.org/)
